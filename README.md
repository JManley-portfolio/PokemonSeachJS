# PokemonSeachJS
Basic Pokemon searching webpage

This began as a project for a javascript certification, but I liked the idea and have since added some extra functionality
Such as showing the shiny form, and displaying the previous and next evolution if they exist as clickable sprites for those pokemon that when clicked will search the pokemon clicked on
